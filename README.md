# DSBSC-simulation-by-MATLAB
This repository contains the MATLAB code for DSBSC method of AM modulation. 
DSBSC is a modified form of Amplitude Modulation. It stands for Double Side Band Suppressed Carrier. It is more efficient than normal Amplitude Modulation. It can also be done using MATLAB simulink library but here I have uploaded the code for the same.
